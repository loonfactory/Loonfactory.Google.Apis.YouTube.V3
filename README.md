# YouTube API V3 for C# Development

## Overview

This project aims to develop a YouTube API V3 client for C# applications, making it easier to interact with YouTube data. The official `Google.Apis.YouTube.v3` library provides extensive features but is complex and not well-suited for Dependency Injection (DI). This project will implement the YouTube API using a DI-friendly approach to create a more flexible and testable structure.

## Goals

- Implement YouTube API functionality based on the official [YouTube API Reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs) to overcome the limitations of `Google.Apis.YouTube.v3`.
- Utilize C# Dependency Injection to create a highly flexible and testable structure.
- Provide an extensible and maintainable API for developers to interact with YouTube data.

## Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Integrate Google login for account access using ASP.NET Core Google login functionality.
- Support API key access for simpler use cases.

### 2. Full YouTube API Implementation
- Implement all functionalities provided in the [YouTube API V3 Reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs):
  - **Video Search**: Search for videos based on keywords.
  - **Channel Info**: Retrieve basic information and statistics for a channel.
  - **Playlist Management**: Create playlists, add videos, and remove videos.
  - **Video Upload & Management**: Upload, edit, and delete videos.
  - **Comment Management**: View, post, and delete comments on videos.
  - **Subscription Management**: Subscribe to and unsubscribe from channels.
  - **Live Streaming Management**: Set up, start, and end live streams.

### 3. Dependency Injection Support
- Separate service interfaces and implementations to facilitate DI container registration.
- Enable easy mocking for unit tests by supporting DI.

## System Architecture

- **API Client Layer**: Handles HTTP communication for YouTube API requests.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Manages user requests and interacts with the client layer to fetch necessary data.
- **Dependency Injection Configuration**: Register `IYouTubeService` and its implementation in `Startup.cs` for DI usage throughout the application.

## Development Environment

- **Language & Framework**: C#, .NET Core 6.0+
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in DI framework
- **HTTP Communication**: `HttpClient`

## Development Approach

This project will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, developing each feature in the following order:
1. **Interface Design**: Define service interfaces to establish clear contracts.
2. **Testing**: Write unit tests for the interfaces using TDD principles.
3. **Implementation**: Develop the classes that fulfill the interface requirements and ensure all tests pass.

## Roadmap

1. **Setup & Initial Structure Design**
   - Initialize the project and set up the directory structure.
   - Design service interfaces that support DI.

2. **Full YouTube API Implementation with TDD**
   - Implement video search, channel info, playlist management, video upload, comment management, subscription management, and live streaming features using TDD.

3. **Testing & DI Integration**
   - Write unit tests using mocking.
   - Verify DI integration and set up the test environment.

4. **Final Review & Documentation**
   - Code review and refactoring.
   - Write developer and user guide documentation.

## Benefits

- Overcome the limitations of the existing library and efficiently interact with YouTube data.
- Achieve a flexible and testable structure through DI, making future maintenance and development easier.
- Provide optimized YouTube integration tailored to project requirements.
- Ensure high code quality and reliability by using TDD throughout the development process.
